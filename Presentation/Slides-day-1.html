## Workshop Series Roadmap

- Get familiar with RStudio Cloud with a warm-up exercise using the tidyverse (today)

- Introduce the survey data we'll be using in the workshop (today)

- Analysis of categorical data with time for practice (today)

- Analysis of continuous data with time for practice (day 2)

- Survey design objects, constructing replicate weights, and creating derived variables (day 3)


???
We assume some familiarity with the tidyverse packages and functions

---
## Logistics

- We will be using RStudio Cloud today to ensure everyone has access

  - RStudio Cloud has the same features and appearance as RStudio for ease of use

- Access the project and files via instructions in email and Zoom chat

- Navigate to "Tidy Survey Analysis in R" under Projects then click name to get started

- We will go through slides of content then work on exercises together in breakout rooms

???
Walk through this
These sessions will not be recorded and we will close RStudio Cloud after the workshop is over but GitHub repo will be available with everything that we cover in this series, such as the code, the slides, etc.
Recommend for the workshops just having Zoom and your RStudio Cloud tab open
---
## Project Contents

## Intro to RStudio Cloud: Penguins!!

- Using `palmerpenguins` data for warm-up exercises

- Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

- Access data through `palmerpenguins` package https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/


####If you are using your own RStudio environment:
- Make sure you have `tidyverse`, `here`, and `palmerpenguins` installed


```r
# Run package installation if you don't have these packages already
# As a reminder, installing takes package from internet to your computer 
# and only needs to be done once, not each session

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here", "palmerpenguins"))
```

???
RStudio Cloud will have packages already installed for you

---
## Intro to RStudio Cloud: Penguins!!

- Load `tidyverse`, `here`, and `palmerpenguins`

- Look at the penguins dataset using `glimpse`


```r
library(tidyverse) # for tidyverse
library(here) # for file paths
library(palmerpenguins) # for warm-up data
glimpse(penguins)
```

Let's walk through how to use RStudio Cloud
Recommend watching this part because then you will try an exercise on your own
---

## Warm-up Exercises: WarmUpExercises.Rmd

- &lt;b&gt;Let's open RStudio Cloud and do some warm-up examples&lt;/b&gt;

- Take 10 minutes to set up RStudio Cloud and do these exercises in breakout rooms. We will then go over together

- Explore the penguins data
   - How many penguins of each species are there? 
   - How many penguins of each species and sex are there? 
   - What is the proportion of each species of penguins?
   - What is the proportion of each sex of penguins within species?


---
## Ex. 1: How many penguins of each species are there? 

.pull-left[

```r
penguins %&gt;%
   count(species)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   species       n
##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Adelie      152
## 2 Chinstrap    68
## 3 Gentoo      124
```
]

.pull-right[

```r
penguins %&gt;%
   group_by(species) %&gt;%
   summarise(
      n=n(), .groups="drop"
   )
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   species       n
##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Adelie      152
## 2 Chinstrap    68
## 3 Gentoo      124
```
]

???
- Using `count` we see there are 3 different species and the number of penguins for each species
---
## Ex. 2: How many penguins of each species and sex are there?


```r
penguins %&gt;%
   count(species, sex)
```

```
## # A tibble: 8 x 3
##   species   sex        n
##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;int&gt;
## 1 Adelie    female    73
## 2 Adelie    male      73
## 3 Adelie    &lt;NA&gt;       6
## 4 Chinstrap female    34
## 5 Chinstrap male      34
## 6 Gentoo    female    58
## 7 Gentoo    male      61
## 8 Gentoo    &lt;NA&gt;       5
```
???
- `count` can take more than one variable to get a cross-tabs between the two variables

---
## Ex. 3: What is the proportion of each species of penguins?


```r
penguins %&gt;%
   count(species) %&gt;%
   mutate(
      p=n/sum(n)
   )
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   species       n     p
##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Adelie      152 0.442
## 2 Chinstrap    68 0.198
## 3 Gentoo      124 0.360
```

---
## What is the proportion of each sex of penguins within species?


```r
penguins %&gt;%
   count(species, sex) %&gt;%
   group_by(species) %&gt;%
   mutate(
      p=n/sum(n)
   )
```

```
## # A tibble: 8 x 4
## # Groups:   species [3]
##   species   sex        n      p
##   &lt;fct&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;  &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 Adelie    female    73 0.480 
## 2 Adelie    male      73 0.480 
## 3 Adelie    &lt;NA&gt;       6 0.0395
## 4 Chinstrap female    34 0.5   
## 5 Chinstrap male      34 0.5   
## 6 Gentoo    female    58 0.468 
## 7 Gentoo    male      61 0.492 
## 8 Gentoo    &lt;NA&gt;       5 0.0403
```

# Survey Datasets
---
## American National Election Studies (ANES) 2020 

- Pre and post election surveys

- Fielded almost every 2 years since 1948

- Topics include voter registration status, candidate preference, opinions on country and government, party and ideology affiliation, opinions on policy, news sources, and more

- Collaboration of Stanford, University of Michigan - funding by the National Science Foundation

- &lt;b&gt;Target Population&lt;/b&gt;: US citizens, 18 and older living in US 

- &lt;b&gt;Mode&lt;/b&gt;: Web, videoconference, or telephone.

- &lt;b&gt;Sample Information&lt;/b&gt;: Pseudo-strata and pseudo-cluster included for variance estimation

https://electionstudies.org/

???
- We have subset the columns of this data and created derived variables, code in repository
- Historically FTF existed but pandemic prevented this

# Categorical descriptive data analysis
---
## Overview of Survey Analysis using `srvyr` Package

1. Create a `tbl_svy` object using: `as_survey_design` or `as_survey_rep`

2. Subset data (if needed) using `filter` (subpopulations)

3. Specify domains of analysis using `group_by` 

4. Within `summarize`, specify variables to calculate including means, totals, proportions, quantiles and more


&lt;b&gt;Note: We will be teaching this in the reverse order!!!&lt;/b&gt;
---

## Weighted Analysis for Categorical Variable

- Functions to use within `summarize` after `group_by`
  - survey_mean/survey_prop
  - survey_total

- Functions to get counts
  - survey_count

???

- we use the same mean and total functions as with continuous variables
- `survey_count` is new
- has a similar structure as the standard (non-survey) version of count


---
## Set-up for Analysis
- `srvyr` package uses tidy-syntax but uses the `survey` package behind it to do calculations

- If using your own RStudio environment, install both packages:

```r
# Install survey and srvyr packages

remotes::install_github("bschneidr/r-forge-survey-mirror")
install.packages("srvyr")
```


- First, we will set-up a design object and talk about what it means in Session 3

```r
library(survey) # for survey analysis
library(srvyr) # for tidy survey analysis

anes &lt;- read_rds(here("Data", "anes_2020.rds")) %&gt;%
   mutate(Weight=Weight/sum(Weight)*231592693) 
# adjust weight to sum to citizen pop, 18+ in Nov 2020 per ANES methodology documentation
anes_des &lt;- anes %&gt;%
   as_survey_design(weights = Weight,
                    strata = Stratum,
                    ids = VarUnit,
                    nest = TRUE)
```
???
- need to install github version of survey package if you want CIs with quantiles
- American National Election Studies
- provides weights that sum to the sample, but we want to get population estimates
- need to adjust the weight to get it to the population count
- we will cover setting up the sample design object later

---
## `survey_count` Syntax

- `survey_count` functions similarly to `count` in that it is &lt;b&gt;NOT&lt;/b&gt; called within `summarize`

- Produces weighted counts and variance of your choice of those counts

```r
survey_count(
   x,
   ...,
   wt = NULL,
   sort = FALSE,
   name = "n",
   .drop = dplyr::group_by_drop_default(x),
   vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv")
)
```
???
- similar to count in that it takes one or many variables
- can change the variance type

---
## `survey_count` Example

- Cross-tab of population in each age group and gender

```r
anes_des %&gt;%
   survey_count(AgeGroup, Gender, name="N")
```

```
## # A tibble: 21 x 4
##    AgeGroup Gender         N     N_se
##    &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
##  1 18-29    Male   21600792. 1418333.
##  2 18-29    Female 22193812. 1766188.
##  3 18-29    &lt;NA&gt;      65204.   56033.
##  4 30-39    Male   19848178. 1077514.
##  5 30-39    Female 19780778. 1158766.
##  6 30-39    &lt;NA&gt;     118195.   62999.
##  7 40-49    Male   17915676. 1123493.
##  8 40-49    Female 18932548.  946369.
##  9 40-49    &lt;NA&gt;      71911.   55174.
## 10 50-59    Male   19054298. 1029844.
## # ... with 11 more rows
```
???
- `survey_count` is placed on its own like `count`
- it does NOT go in a `summarize` function
- can take multiple variables
- can change the output count name, `n` is the default

---
## `survey_mean` and `survey_total` within `summarize`
- Specify the sample design,
- then specify the crosstab in `group_by`,
- then `survey_mean` or `survey_prop` used with no x (variable) calculates a proportion of groups within `summarize`, or
- `survey_total` used with no x (variable) calculates a population count estimate within `summarize`

---
## `survey_mean` and `survey_prop` Syntax


```r
survey_mean(
   x,
   na.rm = FALSE,
   vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv"),
   level = 0.95,
   proportion = FALSE,
   prop_method = c("logit", "likelihood", "asin", "beta", "mean"),
   deff = FALSE,
   df = NULL,
   ...
)

survey_prop(
  vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv"),
  level = 0.95,
  proportion = FALSE,
  prop_method = c("logit", "likelihood", "asin", "beta", "mean"),
  deff = FALSE,
  df = NULL,
  ...
)
```

???
- `proportion`/ `prop_method` impact the CI only


---
## `survey_mean` and `survey_total` Examples

Looking at population by age group as done with `survey_count`.

```r
anes_des %&gt;%
   group_by(AgeGroup) %&gt;%
   summarize(
      p1=survey_mean(),
      p2=survey_prop(),
      N=survey_total(),
      n=unweighted(n()), # this gets unweighted counts aka sample sizes
      .groups="drop" # summarize option to remove groups
   )
```

```
## # A tibble: 7 x 8
##   AgeGroup        p1   p1_se     p2   p2_se         N     N_se     n
##   &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1 18-29       0.189  0.00838 0.189  0.00838 43859809. 2340503.   871
## 2 30-39       0.172  0.00659 0.172  0.00659 39747151. 1556193.  1241
## 3 40-49       0.159  0.00609 0.159  0.00609 36920134. 1452300.  1081
## 4 50-59       0.169  0.00657 0.169  0.00657 39191266. 1602082.  1200
## 5 60-69       0.155  0.00488 0.155  0.00488 35833416. 1214320.  1436
## 6 70 or older 0.119  0.00474 0.119  0.00474 27503517. 1146535.  1330
## 7 &lt;NA&gt;        0.0369 0.00305 0.0369 0.00305  8537401.  710907.   294
```
???
- to get proportions we use `group_by` and `survey_mean`
- also use `survey_total` to get a population count estimate as before

---
## Conditional proportions with more than one group

- Specifying more than one group calculates conditional proportions
- Example: people voting in 2016 and 2020


```r
anes_des %&gt;%
   filter(!is.na(VotedPres2016), !is.na(VotedPres2020)) %&gt;%
   group_by(VotedPres2016, VotedPres2020) %&gt;%
   summarize(
      p=survey_mean(),
      N=survey_total(),
      n=unweighted(n()), 
      .groups="drop"
   )
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 7
##   VotedPres2016 VotedPres2020      p    p_se          N     N_se     n
##   &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;fct&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;

- We will talk more about this next time but filter after creating design object to subset data
- Note that this is the proportion of voting in 2020 by whether people voted in 2016
- What if we don't want conditional proportions?

---
## Joint proportions with more than one group

- Specify an interaction to get joint distribution - use `interact` within `group_by`
- Example: people voting in 2016 and 2020


```r
anes_des %&gt;%
   filter(!is.na(VotedPres2020), !is.na(VotedPres2016)) %&gt;%
*  group_by(interact(VotedPres2016, VotedPres2020)) %&gt;%
   summarize(
      p=survey_mean(),
      N=survey_total(),
      .groups="drop"
   )
```

```

- We add an interaction for the groups
- This outputs the joint distribution

# Categorical data testing and modeling

---
## `svychisq` Syntax

- Testing and modeling is done with the `survey` package
- You can use the same design object


```r
svychisq(formula,
         design, 
         statistic = c("F",  "Chisq", "Wald", "adjWald", "lincom", "saddlepoint"),
         na.rm=TRUE,
         ...)
```
???
- when we want to test categorical distributions we use `svychisq`
- it takes a formula, and the survey design data

---
## `svychisq` Example 1: Function Defaults

- How often can you trust the federal gov't to do what is right?
- How often can you trust other people?


```r
anes_des %&gt;%
   svychisq(design=.,
            formula=~TrustPeople +TrustGovernment)
```

```
## 
## 	Pearson's X^2: Rao &amp; Scott adjustment
## 
## data:  NextMethod()
## F = 29.08, ndf = 11.443, ddf = 583.587, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16
```
???
- We want to compare the distributions of these two questions

---
## `svychisq` Example 2: Wald Statistic

- How often can you trust the federal gov't to do what is right?
- Who did you vote for? Biden, Trump, or Other


```r
anes_des %&gt;%
   svychisq(design=.,
            formula=~TrustGovernment +VotedPres2020_selection,
            statistic="Wald")
```

```
## 
## 	Design-based Wald test of association
## 
## data:  NextMethod()
## F = 6.136, ndf = 8, ddf = 51, p-value = 1.571e-05
```
???
- Can use different statistics


---
## Refresher on formula notation
Symbol | Example | Meaning
-|-|-
+|`+X`|include this variable
-|`-X`|delete this variable
:|`X:Z`|include the interaction between these variables
* |`X*Z`|include these variables and the interactions between them
^n |`(X+Z+Y)^3`|include these variables and all interactions up to n way
I |`I(X-Z)`| as-as: include a new variable which is the difference of these variables

---
## Formula notation - knowledge check

I want to model the following:

`$$mpg_i=\beta_0+\beta_1cyl_{i}+\beta_2disp_{i}+\beta_3hp_{i}+\beta_4cyl_{i}disp_{i}+\beta_5cyl_{i}hp_{i}+\beta_6disp_{i}hp_{i}+\epsilon_i$$`

How can you write this formula? Select all that apply:

1. `mpg~cyl:disp:hp`
2. `mpg~(cyl+disp+hp)^2`
3. `mpg~cyl+disp+hp+cyl:disp+cyl:hp+disp:hp`
4. `mpg~cyl*disp*hp`
5. `mpg~cyl*disp+cyl*hp+disp*hp`

---
## Formula notation - knowledge check (solution)

I want to model the following:

`$$mpg_i=\beta_0+\beta_1cyl_{i}+\beta_2disp_{i}+\beta_3hp_{i}+\beta_4cyl_{i}disp_{i}+\beta_5cyl_{i}hp_{i}+\beta_6disp_{i}hp_{i}+\epsilon_i$$`

How can you write this formula? Select all that apply:

1. `mpg~cyl:disp:hp` - no, this only has the interactions
2. `mpg~(cyl+disp+hp)^2` - yes
3. `mpg~cyl+disp+hp+cyl:disp+cyl:hp+disp:hp` - yes
4. `mpg~cyl*disp*hp` - no, this also has the 3-way interaction
5. `mpg~cyl*disp+cyl*hp+disp*hp` - yes

There may be other ways as well!!!

## Logistic regression with `svyglm`



```r
svyglm(formula, # response ~ terms
       design,
       na.action, #default is na.omit
       family = quasibinomial, # use this to avoid warning about non-integers
       ....)
```

## Example logistic regression
- Predicting trust in government by who someone voted in 2020


```r
filter(anes_des, Weight&gt;0) %&gt;%
   svyglm(design=.,
          formula=TrustGovernment~ VotedPres2020_selection,
          family = quasibinomial) %&gt;%
   summary()
```

```
