---
## Intro to RStudio Cloud: Penguins!!

- Using `palmerpenguins` data for warm-up exercises

- Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

- Access data through `palmerpenguins` package https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/


####If you are using your own RStudio environment:
- Make sure you have `tidyverse`, `here`, and `palmerpenguins` installed

```{r inst_packages, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Run package installation if you don't have these packages already
# As a reminder, installing takes package from internet to your computer 
# and only needs to be done once, not each session

install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here", "palmerpenguins"))
```

---
## Intro to RStudio Cloud: Penguins!!

- Load `tidyverse`, `here`, and `palmerpenguins`

- Look at the penguins dataset using `glimpse`

```{r load_pack1, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # for tidyverse
library(here) # for file paths
library(palmerpenguins) # for warm-up data
glimpse(penguins)
```

---
## Warm-up Exercises: WarmUpExercises.Rmd

- <b>Let's open RStudio cloud and do some warm-up examples</b>

- Take 8 minutes to do these exercises in breakout rooms.

- Explore the penguins data
   - What is the mean body mass in grams of all penguins? Hint: use `summarize` and remove missing data
   
   - What is the mean length of flipper by species? Hint: use `group_by`
   
   - What is the mean flipper length by species and sex? 
   
   - Fit a simple linear regression between body mass and flipper length.


---
## Ex. 1: What is the mean body mass in grams of all penguins? Hint: use `summarize` and remove missing data

```{r peng_meanmass}
penguins %>%
   summarize(
     MeanBodyMass=mean(body_mass_g, 
                       na.rm=TRUE))
```
???
- `na.rm=TRUE` removes missing data from the calculation
    - forgetting this argument will result in a value of `NA` as the function will try to average missing data

---
## Ex. 2: What is the mean length of flipper by species? Hint: use `group_by`

```{r peng_meanflip_species}
penguins %>%
   group_by(species) %>%
   summarize(
     MeanFlipperLength=mean(flipper_length_mm, 
                            na.rm=TRUE))
```
???
- `group_by` allows us to look at metrics by different subgroups like species
- when using `group_by` follow it with `summarize` to get metrics (like average) at the group level

---
## Ex. 3: What is the mean flipper length by species and sex?

```{r peng_meanflip_speciessex}
penguins %>%
   group_by(species,sex) %>%
   summarize(
     MeanFlipperLength=mean(flipper_length_mm, 
                            na.rm=TRUE))
```
???
- As we learned last week with `count`, you can also `group_by` multiple variables

---
## Ex. 4: Fit a simple linear regression between body mass and flipper length.
.small[
```{r pengLM1}
mod1 <- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data=penguins)
summary(mod1)
```
]
???
- here we use the `lm` (linear model) function
- can also use the `glm` (generalized linear model) function
- equation is written as y-variable ~ x-variables

## Overview of Survey Analysis using `srvyr` Package

1. Create a `tbl_svy` object using: `as_survey_design` or `as_survey_rep`

2. Subset data (if needed) using `filter` (subpopulations)

3. Specify domains of analysis using `group_by` 

4. Within `summarize`, specify variables to calculate including means, medians, quantiles and more


<b>Note: We will be teaching this in the reverse order!!!</b>
???
- Session 3 will cover how to create the survey design object

---
## Dataset: Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) 2015

- Energy consumption/expenditures collected through energy suppliers

- Fielded 14 times between 1950 and 2015

- Topics include appliances, electronics, heating, a/c, temperatures, water heating, lighting, energy bills, respondent demographics, and energy assistance

- Funded by the Energy Information Administration

- <b>Target Population</b>: Primary occupied housing units in the US

- <b>Mode</b>: In-person, paper, and web interview mode

- <b>Sample Information</b>: BRR Replicate weights included for variance estimation

https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/index.php

???
- We have subset the columns of this data and created derived variables, code in repository

---
## Set-up for Analysis
- `srvyr` package uses tidy-syntax but uses the `survey` package behind it to do calculations

- If using your own RStudio environment, install both packages:
```{r inst_srv, eval=FALSE}
# Install survey and srvyr packages

remotes::install_github("bschneidr/r-forge-survey-mirror")
install.packages("srvyr")
```

- First, we will set-up a design object and talk about what it means in Session 3
```{r recs_des, error=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(survey) # for survey analysis
library(srvyr) # for tidy survey analysis

recs <- read_rds(here("Data", "recs.rds"))

recs_des <- recs %>%
   as_survey_rep(weights=NWEIGHT,
                 repweights=starts_with("BRRWT"),
                 type="Fay",
                 rho=0.5,
                 mse=TRUE)

```
???
- need to install github version of survey package if you want CIs with quantiles
- we will cover setting up the sample design object later

---
## Weighted Analysis for Continuous Variables

- Common functions for continuous summaries
   - survey_mean
   - survey_total (like sum)
   - survey_median
   - survey_quantile
   - survey_ratio

- Always call within `summarize`/`summarise`
---
## `survey_mean` Syntax

```{r survey_mean_syn, eval=FALSE}
survey_mean(
  x,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv"),
  level = 0.95,
  proportion = FALSE,
  deff = FALSE,
  df = NULL,
  ...
)
```

To calculate a survey mean, we use this in `summarize`/`summarise`
```{r survey_mean_syn2, eval=FALSE}
survey_design_object %>%
   summarize(
      mean_varname=survey_mean(x = continuous_varname)
      )
```

???
Only required argument is the variable

---
## `survey_mean` Example 1: On average, how much do US households spend on energy each year?

This is an example using the `recs_des` survey design object and `survey_mean` function defaults

```{r survey_mean_ex1}
recs_des %>%
   summarize(
      TD_mean=survey_mean(x = TOTALDOL)
      )
```
---
## `survey_mean` Example 2: What is the average temperature US households set their homes to on a summer day?

Run this code. What happens?

```{r survey_mean_ex2, eval=FALSE}
recs_des %>%
   summarize(
      TD_mean=survey_mean(x = SummerTempDay)
      )
```
---
## `survey_mean` Example 2: What is the average temperature US households set their homes to on a summer day?

Run this code. What happens?

```{r survey_mean_ex2_r, error=TRUE}
recs_des %>%
   summarize(
      TD_mean=survey_mean(x = SummerTempDay)
      )
```

<b>How do we fix this code?</b>

???
- missing data in temperature, need `na.rm=TRUE`

---
## `survey_mean` Example 2: Missing data solution

```{r survey_mean_ex2_sol, error=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
recs_des %>%
   summarize(
      TD_mean = survey_mean(
        x = SummerTempDay, 
        na.rm = TRUE )#<<
      )
```

---
## `survey_median` Syntax

```{r survey_median_syn, eval=FALSE}
survey_median(
  x,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  vartype = c("se", "ci"),
  level = 0.95,
  df = NULL,
  ...
)
```

???
Only required argument is the variable


---
## `survey_median` Example: What is the median temperature US households set their homes to on a summer day?

.pull-left[
```{r survey_median_fib, eval=FALSE}
recs_des %>%
   summarize(
      TD_median=survey_median(x=_________,
                          na.rm=_________)
      )
```
]
--
.pull-right[
```{r survey_median_fib_sol}
recs_des %>%
 summarize(
   TD_median=survey_median(x=SummerTempDay,
                           na.rm=TRUE)
 )
```
]
???
- Mean temperature set is 72.4 degrees Fahrenheit with a standard error of 0.08
- Median temperature set is 72 degrees Fahrenheit with a standard error of 0.25


---
## `survey_quantile` Syntax

```{r survey_quantile_syn, eval=FALSE}
survey_quantile(
  x,
  quantiles, #<<
  na.rm = FALSE,
  vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv"),
  level = 0.95,
  df = NULL,
  ...
)
```

???
- need both the variable and the quantiles in a vector e.g. (c(.25, .75))

---
## `survey_quantile` Example 1: What are the 1st and 3rd quantile of dollars spent on energy?

```{r survey_quantile_ex1, error=TRUE}
recs_des %>%
   summarize(
      Spent=survey_quantile(
        x = TOTALDOL,
        quantiles = c(.25, .75)) #<<
      )
```
???
- This estimates the 25th and 75th percentile

---
## `survey_quantile` Example 2:  What are the 1st and 3rd quantile of dollars spent on energy with confidence intervals?

```{r survey_quantile_ex2, error=TRUE}
recs_des %>%
   summarize(
      Spent=survey_quantile(x = TOTALDOL,
                            quantiles = c(.25, .75),
                            vartype = "ci" #<<
         )
      )
```

---
## `survey_quantile` Updated Output

```{r survey_quantile_ex2a, error=TRUE}
recs_des %>%
   summarize(
      Spent=survey_quantile(x = TOTALDOL,
                            quantiles = c(.25, .75),
                            vartype = "ci"
         )
      ) %>% 
   pivot_longer(cols=c(Spent_q25:Spent_q75_upp),
                names_to="varname",values_to="value") %>% 
   mutate(Quantile=paste0(str_sub(varname,8,9),"th Quantile"),
          type=case_when(str_detect(varname,"_low")~"Lower_Bound",
                         str_detect(varname,"_upp")~"Upper_Bound",
                         TRUE~"Estimate")) %>% 
   pivot_wider(id_cols=Quantile,names_from=type,values_from=value)
```


---
## `survey_ratio` Syntax

- Note this estimates: $\sum x_i/\sum y_i$ not $\sum \frac{x_i}{y_i}$

```{r survey_ratio_syn, eval=FALSE}
survey_ratio(
  numerator, #<<
  denominator, #<<
  na.rm = FALSE,
  vartype = c("se", "ci", "var", "cv"),
  level = 0.95,
  deff = FALSE,
  df = NULL,
  ...
)
```


---
## `survey_ratio` Example: What is the average dollar per BTU spent on energy?

```{r survey_ratio_ex}
recs_des %>%
   summarize(
      DolPerBTU=survey_ratio(
         numerator = TOTALDOL, #<<
         denominator = TOTALBTU, #<<
         na.rm = TRUE
         )
      )
```
???
- BTU (British Thermal Units)

---
## Breakout rooms: Practice time

- Open ContinuousExercises.Rmd and work through Part 1

- We will take 15 minutes. Use this time for the exercises and questions.

---
## Weighted Analysis for Continuous Variables: Domain Analysis

- If we want to get estimates by another variable, we need to add a `group_by` statement before doing the analysis.

- Example: What is the average amount of dollars spent on electricity for households that use AC and those that do not use AC?

```{r domain_ex}
recs_des %>%
  group_by(ACUsed) %>% #<<
  summarize(
    ElBill=survey_mean(DOLLAREL, 
                       na.rm=TRUE)
  )
```
---
## Domain Analysis: Totals

- If we want the overall average electric bill too, use the `cascade` function instead of `summarize`

```{r domain_ex_casc}
recs_des %>%
   group_by(ACUsed) %>%
   cascade(
      ElBill=survey_mean(DOLLAREL, 
                         na.rm=TRUE)
   )

```

<b>Note: The overall average electric bill appears as NA</b>

---
## Domain Analysis: Totals

- Also can add sample and pop sizes

```{r domain_tot}
recs_des %>%
   group_by(ACUsed) %>%
   cascade(
      ElBill=survey_mean(DOLLAREL, na.rm=TRUE),
      N=survey_total(!is.na(DOLLAREL)), #<<
      n=unweighted(sum(!is.na(DOLLAREL))) #<<
   )

```

???
- survey_total gets a weighted total
- unweighted does just that, an unweighted estimate, can also get an unweighted mean or any other stat

---
## Weighted Analysis for Specific Subpopulations

- filtering (subsetting) the data should be done AFTER specifying the design to ensure accurate standard errors

- Use the `filter` function after creating the survey design object and before summarizing

Wrong way:
```{r filter_bad, eval = FALSE}
data %>%
  filter(state=="NC") %>% #<<
  as_survey_design(...) %>%
  summarize(AvgAge=mean(Age))
```

Right way:
```{r filter_good, eval=FALSE}
data %>%
  as_survey_design(...) %>%
  filter(state=="NC") %>% #<<
  summarize(AvgAge=mean(Age))
```

???
- Required to ensure correct calculation when sub-population is not in all strata or PSUs

---
## Subpopulation Example: Average electric cost of single family homes

```{r subpop1}
recs_des %>%
  filter(HousingUnitType %in% c("Single-family detached",
                                "Single-family attached")) %>%
  summarize(
    ElBill=survey_mean(DOLLAREL, 
                       na.rm=TRUE)
  )
```

???
- Filter goes AFTER the design object
- Previous syntax showed the creation of the design object, but with this example, we already created it

---
## Comparisons with t-tests: `svyttest` Syntax

- t-tests are done in the package `survey` not `srvyr` but you can use the same design object

```{r ttest_syn1, eval=FALSE}
svyttest(formula, # outcome~group for two-sample, outcome~0 for one-sample
         design,
         na.rm = FALSE
         ....)
```

???
- Uses standard R formula notation
- will go over examples of 1-sample, 2-sample, and paired t-test

---
## `svyttest` Syntax with `%>%`

```{r ttest_syn2, eval=FALSE}
recs_des %>%
   svyttest(formula=,
            design=., #<<
            na.rm=TRUE)
```

???
- To use in tidyverse need the "dot" notation as highlighted here
- Pipe then puts the design object in the correct placement


---
## `svyttest` Syntax with `%>%`

```{r ttest_syn3, eval=FALSE}
recs_des %>%
   svyttest(design=., #<<
            formula=,
            na.rm=TRUE)
```

???
- Order doesn't matter for the arguments when you use the "dot" notation


---
## `svyttest` Example 1: One-sample t-test

- I keep my house at 68 degrees at night during the summer. Is this different from the national average?

```{r ttest_ex1}
recs_des %>%
   svyttest(design=.,
            formula=I(SummerTempNight-68)~0, #<<
            na.rm=TRUE)
```

???
- Note the I notation, this does the arithmetic before modeling

---
## `svyttest` Example 2: Comparing two variables

- Do people keep their house the same temperature at night during the summer and the winter?

```{r ttest_ex2}
recs_des %>%
   svyttest(design=.,
            formula=I(SummerTempNight-WinterTempNight)~0,
            na.rm=TRUE)
```

???
- this is a paired t-test
- testing whether the difference is 0 for each household

---
## `svyttest` Example 3: Two-sample t-test

- Are electric bills different between those with and without A/C?

```{r ttest_ex3}
recs_des %>%
   svyttest(design=.,
            formula=DOLLAREL~ACUsed,
            na.rm=TRUE)
```



---
## Linear Regression or ANOVA: `svyglm` Syntax

- As with t-tests, regressions are done in the package `survey` not `srvyr` but you can use the same design object

- Syntax is similar between t-test and glm

```{r glm_syn, eval=FALSE}
svyglm(formula, 
       design,
       na.action, #default is na.omit
       ....)
```
---
## `svyglm` Example: Two-sample

Same example as two-sample t-test: Are electric bills different between those with and without A/C?

<b>t-test:</b>
```{r twosamp_ex_ttest, eval=FALSE}
recs_des %>%
   svyttest(design=.,
            formula=DOLLAREL~ACUsed,
            na.rm=TRUE) #<<
```

<b>glm:</b>
```{r twosamp_ex_glm, eval=FALSE}
recs_des %>%
   svyglm(design=.,
          formula=DOLLAREL~ACUsed,
          na.action=na.omit) #<<
```

???
- one major difference in how you specify to ignore NA values
- svyttest can only have 2-levels in group variable
- svyglm, the variable on right can be anything (continuous or factor)

---
## `svyglm` Example: Two-sample

Are electric bills different between those with and without A/C?
.small[
```{r twosamp_ex_ttest_run}
recs_des %>%
   svyglm(design=.,
          formula=DOLLAREL~ACUsed,
          na.action=na.omit) %>%
  summary()
```
]

???
- same results as t-test

---
## `svyglm` Example 1: ANOVA Test

Does temperature of AC at night vary by region?
.smaller[
```{r anova_ex}
recs_des %>%
   svyglm(design=.,
          formula=SummerTempNight~Region,
          na.action=na.omit) %>%
  summary()

```
]

???
- Region is a factor variable, if it is numeric - this will treat it like a linear model

---
## `svyglm` Example 2: Linear Model

- Is there a relationship between square footage and electric bill?
- Let's review the data first with a ggplot. <i>Note we use the original data and do <b>NOT</b> use the survey design object.</i>

```{r plot_sf_elbill}
p <- recs %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=TOTSQFT_EN, y=DOLLAREL, weight=NWEIGHT)) +
  geom_hex(color="white") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(guide="colourbar",name="Count of Housing Units",labels=comma)

```

???
- When using the original data, make sure you include the weight variable

---
## `svyglm` Example 2: Linear Model
```{r plot_sf_elbill_disp, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=9/16, fig.align="center", out.width="90%", dpi=300}
p +
  theme_bw() 
```


---
## `svyglm` Example 2: Linear Model
.small[
```{r lm_ex}
m_electric_sqft <- recs_des %>%
   svyglm(design=.,
          formula=DOLLAREL~TOTSQFT_EN,
