## VotedPres2016

PRE: DID R VOTE FOR PRESIDENT IN 2016

*Revised:* Four years ago, in 2016, Hillary Clinton ran on the Democratic ticket against Donald Trump for the Republicans. We talk to many people who tell us they did not vote. And we talk to a few people who tell us they did vote, who really did not. We can tell they did not vote by checking with official government records. What about you? If we check the official government voter records, will they show that you voted in the 2016 presidential election, or that you did not vote in that election?

```{r variable-VotedPres2016}
